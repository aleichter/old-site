I LOVE to learn.  I am constantly exploring new technologies, techniques, and leadership practices because I believe there is no maintaining the status quo.  There is only falling behind or moving forward.  

### More Information

I currently have the pleasure to serve as the Chief Technology Officer at [EPSoft](https://www.epsoftinc.com).  Please ask me about the great work we are doing to elevate the human potential.  

The purpose of this site is to document my own personal learning journey and to demonstrate that learning is the continual process of failing forward.  By documenting these lessons here it will be give me a place to come back to and appreciate the journey. My other motivation is you.  I want to use my own journey to encourage and inspire others to keep pushing forward and know that the path to success is preceded by lots of experimentation.  I believe you MUST do this experimentation outside of a business setting.  The risk is low and the reward is high.
