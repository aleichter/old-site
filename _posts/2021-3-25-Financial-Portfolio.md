I am starting a learning journey that will start with Event Sourcing, however, in my initial research I already see that it will include a number of varying topics.  I'm sure I will learn much on Event Storming, Event Modeling, Test Driven Development, Functional Programming, and more.  Look for tags related to those topics to learn more.  All posts related to this learning project will be tagged with [#financialPortfolio](/financialPortfolio).  If you want to learn more about the project itself check out the README.md file in the projects github page here [Financial Portfolio](https://github.com/aleichter/financial-portfolio)
