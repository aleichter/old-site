title: I know this should already be obvious but... start with the UI

My point is really to start with the most public API as some teams can't start with the UI if they are not a UI team but since I'm doing this whole thing myself the most public interface is the UI since I should have started there at the start I'm going to go ahead and start there now.  Long terms, as with everything else I'm doing here, I will implement multiple versions of the UI for comparison.  React, Angular, and maybe Blazor (might give me an opportunity to flex my long dormant C# muscles.  I do miss C#).
