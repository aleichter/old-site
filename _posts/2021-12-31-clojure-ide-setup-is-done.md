* **IDE Setup** - Done.  I'm using VS Code as my IDE and Calva seems to be the only extension needed for me to be productive.  In order to really support a personal workflow, however, Leiningen is required to be installed on your system.  I've used homebrew since I'm on a mac.  <a href="https://calva.io/">Calva</a>
* **Build Environment** - In progress.  
* **Docker Image Build** - Not started.
* **Unit Test Framework** - In progress.  Leinigen does have a command to run tests, however, I have no idea if code coverage is included in this so I'll need more research and experimentation.
* **Linting** - Not started.
